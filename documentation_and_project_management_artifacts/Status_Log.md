| 2025-05-19 | Project officially launched. Identified cleaned CSV datasets from the `pitch-by-pitch-pro` repository (`/data/clean/`) as the primary data source.                    | huihao li        | Decided to use existing cleaned datasets to avoid redundant preprocessing.                                                       |
| 2025-05-19 | Implemented data loading functions for batter and pitcher stats (Cubs & White Sox) using Pandas. CSV files include BA, OBP, SLG, and ERA columns.                     | huihao li        | Verified required columns and added fallback values for missing or invalid entries.                                              |
| 2025-05-19 | Defined key simulation classes: `Player`, `Pitcher`, and `GameState`. Structured the core script for future extensibility.                                             | huihao li        | Completed initial class templates with basic attributes. AI assistant provided helpful scaffolding.                              |
| 2025-05-19 | Developed and tested `simulate_at_bat_no_print` function to determine at-bat results using weighted probabilities.                                                     | huihao li        | Outcome logic based on hitter stats and opposing pitcher's ERA was successfully integrated.                                       |
| 2025-05-19 | Created functions for inning and full game simulation (`simulate_inning_half_no_print`, `simulate_game_no_print`).                                                    | huihao li        | Established rule flow for 9-inning structure and early game-end conditions.                                                      |
| 2025-05-19 | Built Monte Carlo simulation loop with 1000 iterations to simulate batches of games. Results stored as win counts and percentages.                                    | huihao li        | Loop optimization completed. Simplified tie games by excluding them from win percentage calculation.                             |
| 2025-05-19 | Initialized GitHub repository `baseball-simulation-project` and organized files into required directories (`functional_code`, `prepared_data`, etc.).                  | huihao li        | Ensured project meets the assignmentâ€™s folder structure expectations.                                                            |
| 2025-05-19 | Drafted all required project documents (Functional Specs, WBS, Product Backlog, Status Log, etc.). Used AI tools to assist with initial wording and formatting.        | huihao li        | All project management artifacts drafted. To be refined during final review.                                                     |
| 2025-05-21 | Final review of project documents completed. Verified alignment with submission requirements.                                                                         | huihao li        | Documentation finalized and confirmed for completeness.                                                                          |
| 2025-05-22 | Ran extended simulation of 10,000 games. Model produced stable win rates across batches and handled input variability without errors.                                  | huihao li        | Confirmed model robustness under large-scale execution; no functional issues observed.                                           |

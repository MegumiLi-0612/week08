# Functional Specifications: Baseball Monte Carlo Simulation

## 1. Project Summary

This document specifies the key functionalities and expectations for the Baseball Monte Carlo Simulation. The simulation models a series of baseball games between two teams using statistical data from CSV files and estimates win probabilities based on repeated simulations.

## 2. User Stories

- **US-001:** As a user, I want to simulate a full baseball match between two selected teams (e.g., Cubs vs. White Sox) to observe possible outcomes.
- **US-002:** As a user, I expect batter performance in the simulation to be influenced by their real-life stats (AVG, OBP, SLG).
- **US-003:** As a user, I want pitcher performance (e.g., ERA) to influence game outcomes, particularly during at-bats.
- **US-004:** As a user, I want each game to follow standard rules over 9 innings.
- **US-005:** As a user, I want to simulate thousands of games to generate reliable win rate estimates using Monte Carlo methods.
- **US-006:** As a user, I want to see a summary of win rates for each team after all simulations finish.
- **US-007:** As a developer, I need a game engine that handles scorekeeping, outs, innings, and base-running logically.

| R-011  | After simulation, the system must report win counts and win rates per team.                          | US-006             | High     |
| R-012  | If CSV data is missing or malformed, the system should fall back to default values to continue.      | N/A                | Medium   |

| AC-002 | R-002                  | The simulation should yield a range of outcomes with realistic diversity (e.g., no single result dominates).          |

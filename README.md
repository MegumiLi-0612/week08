Baseball Monte Carlo Simulation Project
### 1. Introduction
This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation for baseball games to predict win probabilities between two teams (Chicago Cubs vs. Chicago White Sox). The simulation uses player statistics (Batting Average, On-Base Percentage, Slugging Percentage for batters; ERA for pitchers) loaded from CSV data files. It runs a large number of simulated games (e.g., 10,000) to derive statistical outcomes.

The primary outputs include:

Text-based win percentages for each team.
A comparative bar chart showing the score distribution for both teams.
A line chart illustrating the cumulative win percentage for each team as more simulations are run.
This project was developed as part of the "Discussion 8 | Monte Carlo Simulation" assignment, emphasizing code organization, data management, and project management practices, including collaboration with AI (Gemini).
### 2. Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

baseball-simulation-project/

README.md (This file)
documentation_and_project_management_artifacts/
Activity_List.md
Functional_Specs.md
Product_Backlog.md
Roadmap.md
Status_Log.md
Work_Breakdown_Structure.md

cubs_standard_pitching_clean.csv
whitesox_standard_batting_clean.csv
whitesox_standard_pitching_clean.csv
results/
comparative_score_distribution.png
cumulative_win_percentage.png
/functional_code/: Contains the Python script (baseball_simulation.py) that runs the simulation.

/prepared_data/: Contains the cleaned CSV data files for player and pitcher statistics used by the simulation. These files were sourced from the pitch-by-pitch-pro repository.

/documentation_and_project_management_artifacts/: Houses all project planning and documentation. See links below for details.

/results/: Stores the visual outputs (plots) generated by the simulation.

README.md: Provides an overview of the project (this file).

### 3. How to Run

**Prerequisites**:
Ensure Python is installed, along with the required libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`. Install them using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
```

**Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MegumiLi-0612/week08.git
cd baseball-simulation-project
```

**Verify Data Availability**:
Confirm that the `prepared_data` directory contains the following CSV files:

* `cubs_standard_batting_clean.csv`
* `cubs_standard_pitching_clean.csv`
* `whitesox_standard_batting_clean.csv`
* `whitesox_standard_pitching_clean.csv`

**Run the Simulation**:

```bash
cd functional_code
python baseball_simulation.py
```

**View Results**:

* Win percentages will be printed to the console.
* Output plots will be saved as image files (`comparative_score_distribution.png` and `cumulative_win_percentage.png`) in the `results` directory.

  > Note: If the `results` folder does not exist, the script will create it automatically. You can also customize the save path in the script.

### 4. Project Management & Documentation

Comprehensive planning and progress tracking artifacts are provided in the `documentation_and_project_management_artifacts` folder:

* **Functional Specifications**: Defines key requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria.
* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**: Breaks the project down into major tasks and subtasks.
* **Product Backlog**: Contains a prioritized list of features and technical tasks.
* **Status Log**: Chronicles the project's progress, challenges, and decisions over time.
* **Activity List**: Records development actions in a timestamped log.
* **Roadmap**: Outlines key milestones and the overall project timeline.

### 5. AI Collaboration

Generative AI (Gemini) was used as a co-developer to support the following activities:

* Structuring the initial codebase and generating boilerplate code.
* Drafting and refining project documentation.
* Brainstorming design decisions and assisting with debugging.
* Generating specific code snippets (e.g., for data visualization).

Details of the AI's contributions are recorded in the **Status Log** and **Activity List**.

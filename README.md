Baseball Monte Carlo Simulation Project
1. Introduction
This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation for baseball games to predict win probabilities between two teams (Chicago Cubs vs. Chicago White Sox). The simulation uses player statistics (Batting Average, On-Base Percentage, Slugging Percentage for batters; ERA for pitchers) loaded from CSV data files. It runs a large number of simulated games (e.g., 10,000) to derive statistical outcomes.

The primary outputs include:

Text-based win percentages for each team.
A comparative bar chart showing the score distribution for both teams.
A line chart illustrating the cumulative win percentage for each team as more simulations are run.
This project was developed as part of the "Discussion 8 | Monte Carlo Simulation" assignment, emphasizing code organization, data management, and project management practices, including collaboration with AI (Gemini).
